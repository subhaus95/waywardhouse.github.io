## Series Overview

Remote sensing extends human perception across wavelengths invisible to the eye and provides synoptic Earth observation impossible from the ground. This series develops the physics and signal processing underlying modern Earth observation, from hyperspectral imaging through synthetic aperture radar to gravity field measurements.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

**Physics determines capability.** Each wavelength interacts differently with Earth's surface. Understanding electromagnetic and gravitational physics reveals what can be measured and what cannot.

**Signal processing essential.** Raw sensor data requires substantial processing. Students learn algorithms, not just interpretation.

**Active vs passive dichotomy.** Passive sensors (optical, thermal, microwave radiometry) detect natural emissions. Active sensors (LiDAR, SAR) illuminate targets. Different physics, different information.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Interpret hyperspectral signatures** and apply spectral unmixing
2. **Calculate surface temperature** from thermal infrared with emissivity correction
3. **Process LiDAR point clouds** for terrain and vegetation structure
4. **Implement SAR image formation** and interferometry
5. **Analyze gravity field changes** from GRACE satellite measurements
6. **Apply passive microwave** for soil moisture and sea ice
7. **Select appropriate sensors** for measurement objectives
8. **Quantify retrieval uncertainty** from sensor characteristics

## Mathematical Progression

**Optical:** Radiative transfer, linear algebra (unmixing)

**Thermal:** Stefan-Boltzmann, Planck's law, atmospheric correction

**LiDAR:** Geometry, waveform processing, classification algorithms

**SAR:** Fourier processing, complex numbers, phase unwrapping

**Gravity:** Spherical harmonics, potential theory

**Microwave:** Dielectric properties, emissivity models

## Computational Skills

- Spectral signature analysis
- Point cloud processing
- SAR focusing algorithms
- Phase unwrapping (branch cuts, minimum cost flow)
- Spherical harmonic decomposition
- Bayesian retrieval inversions

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Series 1 (calculus, complex numbers)

**Helpful:** Series 2 Model 13 (radiation basics), Series 3 Model 29-30 (raster processing)

**Not required:** Prior remote sensing background

## Entry Points

**LiDAR applications:** Models 54-55 accessible with Series 1

**SAR/InSAR:** Models 56-57 most mathematically demanding

**Climate/hydrology:** Models 58-59 (gravity, passive microwave)

**Optical background:** Models 52-53 extend visible/NIR knowledge

## Key Insights

1. **Wavelength selection critical.** Different wavelengths penetrate atmosphere, vegetation, water differently.

2. **Active sensors all-weather.** Radar/LiDAR work through clouds; optical does not.

3. **Phase information powerful.** InSAR detects millimeter deformations from satellite altitude.

4. **Resolution tradeoffs.** Spatial vs spectral vs temporal. Cannot maximize all simultaneously.

5. **Atmospheric correction essential.** Water vapor, aerosols corrupt surface signal.

6. **Viewing geometry matters.** Incidence angle affects backscatter, thermal emission.

7. **Validation requires ground truth.** Remote sensing retrievals are models, not direct measurements.

## Applications

- Mineral exploration (hyperspectral)
- Urban heat mapping (thermal IR)
- Forest structure (LiDAR)
- Seafloor mapping (bathymetric LiDAR)
- Flood extent (SAR)
- Earthquake deformation (InSAR)
