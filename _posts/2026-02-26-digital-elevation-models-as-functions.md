  Terrain has structure: it rises and falls continuously across space. We can
  represent elevation as a mathematical function z = f(x, y), where every point
  in the horizontal plane has a unique elevation. In practice, we discretize this
  into a raster grid. This model bridges continuous mathematics and digital data.

## 1. The Question

How do we represent the shape of the land mathematically?

A landscape is not flat. Mountains rise, valleys sink, hillslopes tilt. Every point on the surface has an **elevation** above some reference (usually sea level).

If we know the coordinates $(x, y)$ of a point on the ground, can we write down a function that gives us the elevation $z$?

**Yes** — and this is the foundation of **terrain analysis**, **hydrology**, **viewshed modeling**, and **landslide prediction**.

The mathematical question: How do we go from a continuous surface to a computable representation?

---

## 2. The Conceptual Model

### Terrain as a Function

Imagine standing at a point with coordinates $(x, y)$ measured in meters east and north from some origin. The elevation at that point is $z$.

**Mathematically:**

$$z = f(x, y)$$

This is a **function of two variables**:
- **Input:** A position $(x, y)$ in the horizontal plane
- **Output:** Elevation $z$ at that position

**Examples of terrain functions:**

1. **Flat plane:** $z = 100$ (elevation is constant everywhere)
2. **Tilted plane:** $z = 500 + 0.05x - 0.02y$ (uniform slope)
3. **Cone:** $z = 1000 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (peak at origin, decreasing radially)
4. **Saddle:** $z = x^2 - y^2$ (up in one direction, down in the perpendicular direction)

Real terrain is more complex, but the **concept** is the same: elevation is determined by position.

### From Continuous to Discrete

In reality, we can't write down a simple algebraic formula for real terrain. Instead, we **measure** elevation at many points and store the values in a grid.

**Digital Elevation Model (DEM):** A raster grid where each cell contains the elevation of the terrain at that location.

**Grid structure:**
- Rows and columns define positions
- Cell size (resolution) determines how finely we sample the terrain (e.g., 10 m × 10 m cells)
- Elevation values are stored as numbers (integers or floating point)

**Example:** A 5×5 DEM (rows from north to south, columns from west to east):

```
110  115  120  125  130
108  112  118  124  129
105  110  115  121  127
103  108  113  118  123
100  105  110  115  120
```

Each number is the elevation (in meters) at the center of that cell.

## 3. Building the Mathematical Model

### Defining the Coordinate System

To turn a grid into a function, we need to define:
1. **Origin:** Where is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$?
2. **Cell size:** $\Delta x$ (east-west), $\Delta y$ (north-south)
3. **Grid extent:** How many rows and columns?

**Standard convention:**
- x increases **eastward**
- y increases **northward**
- Origin is typically the **southwest corner** of the grid

If the grid has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, with cell size $\Delta x = \Delta y = d$:

$$x_j = x_0 + j \cdot d, \quad j = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$$
$$y_i = y_0 + i \cdot d, \quad i = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1$$

The elevation at grid cell $(i, j)$ is $z_{i,j}$.

### From Grid Indices to Coordinates

Given a grid cell index $(i, j)$, the corresponding real-world coordinates are:

$$(x, y) = (x_0 + j \cdot d, \; y_0 + i \cdot d)$$

**Example:** Grid with origin $(x_0, y_0) = (500000, 4500000)$ (UTM coordinates), cell size $d = 30$ m, cell $(i=2, j=3)$:

$$x = 500000 + 3 \times 30 = 500090 \text{ m}$$
$$y = 4500000 + 2 \times 30 = 4500060 \text{ m}$$

### Interpolating Between Grid Points

A DEM gives elevation only at grid cell **centers**. What about points between cells?

**Bilinear interpolation:** Given a point $(x, y)$ inside a grid cell, interpolate elevation using the four surrounding cell values.

Let the four corners have elevations $z_{00}, z_{01}, z_{10}, z_{11}$ at positions:

$$\begin{align}
(x_0, y_0) &\rightarrow z_{00} \\
(x_0, y_1) &\rightarrow z_{01} \\
(x_1, y_0) &\rightarrow z_{10} \\
(x_1, y_1) &\rightarrow z_{11}
\end{align}$$

For a point $(x, y)$ with $x_0 < x < x_1$ and $y_0 < y < y_1$:

$$z(x, y) = (1 - s)(1 - t) z_{00} + s(1 - t) z_{10} + (1 - s)t z_{01} + st z_{11}$$

Where:

$$s = \frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0}, \quad t = \frac{y - y_0}{y_1 - y_0}$$

This creates a **piecewise continuous surface** — smooth within each cell, potentially discontinuous at cell boundaries.

## 4. Worked Example by Hand

**Problem:** A 3×3 DEM has cell size 10 m and origin at $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$. Elevations (in meters):

```
Row 0:  100  105  110
Row 1:  102  107  112
Row 2:  105  110  115
```

(a) What is the elevation at grid cell $(i=1, j=2)$?  
(b) What are the real-world coordinates of this cell center?  
(c) Estimate the elevation at point $(x, y) = (15, 5)$ using bilinear interpolation.

### Solution

**(a) Elevation at cell (1, 2)**

Row 1, column 2: $z_{1,2} = 112$ m

**(b) Coordinates of cell center**

$$x = x_0 + j \cdot d = 0 + 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ m}$$
$$y = y_0 + i \cdot d = 0 + 1 \times 10 = 10 \text{ m}$$

Cell center: **(20, 10)** m

**(c) Interpolation at (15, 5)**

Point $(15, 5)$ lies between cells:
- $x$: between column 1 ($x = 10$) and column 2 ($x = 20$)
- $y$: between row 0 ($y = 0$) and row 1 ($y = 10$)

Four corner elevations:
- $(10, 0)$: $z = 105$ (row 0, col 1)
- $(20, 0)$: $z = 110$ (row 0, col 2)
- $(10, 10)$: $z = 107$ (row 1, col 1)
- $(20, 10)$: $z = 112$ (row 1, col 2)

Interpolation parameters:

$$s = \frac{15 - 10}{20 - 10} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$$

$$t = \frac{5 - 0}{10 - 0} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$$

Interpolated elevation:

$$\begin{align}
z(15, 5) &= (1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.5)(105) + (0.5)(1 - 0.5)(110) \\
&\quad + (1 - 0.5)(0.5)(107) + (0.5)(0.5)(112) \\
&= 0.25 \times 105 + 0.25 \times 110 + 0.25 \times 107 + 0.25 \times 112 \\
&= 26.25 + 27.5 + 26.75 + 28 \\
&= 108.5 \text{ m}
\end{align}$$

**Elevation at (15, 5): 108.5 m**

**Try this:**
- **Cone:** Radial symmetry, single peak
- **Saddle:** Up in one direction, down in perpendicular direction (mountain pass)
- **Plane:** Uniform slope (no curvature)
- **Ridge:** Linear high feature
- **Valley:** Linear low feature
- Increase resolution: Smoother surface, more cells, same terrain shape
- Decrease resolution: Coarser surface, blockier appearance

**Key insight:** The mathematical function is continuous, but the DEM is discrete. Higher resolution approximates the continuous surface better.

## 6. Interpretation

### Resolution and Detail

**Coarse DEM** (90 m cells):
- Good for regional analysis
- Misses small features (gullies, terraces)
- Fast to process

**Fine DEM** (1 m cells):
- Captures detailed topography
- Required for local hydrology, erosion modeling
- Large file sizes, slower computation

**Rule of thumb:** Cell size should be smaller than the features you care about.

### Vertical Accuracy vs. Horizontal Resolution

A DEM with 10 m horizontal resolution might have:
- ±1 m vertical accuracy (high-quality lidar)
- ±10 m vertical accuracy (older photogrammetry)

**Don't confuse the two.** Resolution is spacing; accuracy is error.

### Edge Effects

At the edge of a DEM, there are no neighboring cells beyond the boundary. Calculations requiring neighbors (slope, aspect) are undefined or require special handling (mirror, clamp, or mark as no-data).

---

## 7. What Could Go Wrong?

### Confusing Row/Column with X/Y

**Common error:** Treating row index as x-coordinate.

**Correct:**
- Row index $i$ corresponds to **y-coordinate** (north-south)
- Column index $j$ corresponds to **x-coordinate** (east-west)

Always check your coordinate system convention.

### Assuming Regular Grids

Not all DEMs are regular grids:
- **Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs):** Points connected by triangles (better for sparse data)
- **Irregular point clouds:** Lidar before gridding

This model focuses on regular grids (rasters) because they're simpler and more common.

### Interpolation Artifacts

Bilinear interpolation creates a **piecewise planar surface** — each cell becomes a flat facet. This can introduce:
- Artificial terracing
- Discontinuous slopes at cell boundaries

More sophisticated interpolation (bicubic, splines) can smooth these, but at computational cost.

### Coordinate Reference Systems

Real-world DEMs use **projected coordinate systems** (e.g., UTM) or **geographic coordinates** (latitude/longitude). Geographic coordinates are **not** uniform in distance — 1° longitude spans different distances at different latitudes.

Always check the CRS before doing distance-based calculations.

## 8. Extension: Functions of Two Variables in Calculus

A function $z = f(x, y)$ defines a **surface** in 3D space.

**Partial derivatives** measure how the surface changes when you move in one direction while holding the other constant:

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \text{rate of change in the x-direction (eastward)}$$

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = \text{rate of change in the y-direction (northward)}$$

In terrain analysis:
- $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ is the **east-west slope component**
- $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$ is the **north-south slope component**

**Next model (Model 8)** will show how to compute these from a DEM using **finite differences** and combine them into **gradient** and **aspect**.

---

## 9. Math Refresher: Functions of Two Variables

### Notation

$$z = f(x, y)$$

**Read as:** "z is a function of x and y."

### Example

$$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$$

**Evaluation:**
- $f(3, 4) = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$
- $f(0, 0) = 0$
- $f(-1, 2) = 1 + 4 = 5$

### Level Curves (Contour Lines)

A **level curve** is the set of all $(x, y)$ points where $f(x, y)$ equals a constant.

**Example:** For $z = x^2 + y^2$, the level curve $z = 25$ is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ (radius 5).

In terrain, level curves are **contour lines** — lines of constant elevation.

---

## Summary

- Terrain can be represented as a function $z = f(x, y)$
- A **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** discretizes this function into a raster grid
- Grid cells have indices $(i, j)$ corresponding to coordinates $(x, y)$
- **Bilinear interpolation** estimates elevation between grid points
- **Resolution** (cell size) determines how finely the terrain is sampled
- Functions of two variables define surfaces; partial derivatives measure slope
- Real DEMs require careful attention to coordinate systems and interpolation methods
