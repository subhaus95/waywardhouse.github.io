  Water always flows downhill, following the path of steepest descent. Given a

## 1. The Question

Where does the water go?

A raindrop lands on a hillslope. Gravity pulls it downhill. At each point, it moves in the direction of steepest descent — the direction where elevation drops fastest. It continues until it reaches a stream, a lake, or the edge of the DEM.

If we know the elevation at every point, can we predict:
1. **Flow direction** — which way does water move from each cell?
2. **Flow accumulation** — how much water passes through each cell?
3. **Watersheds** — which areas drain to the same outlet?
4. **Stream networks** — where do channels form?

All four questions are answered by the same fundamental algorithm: **routing flow according to the gradient**.

---

## 2. The Conceptual Model

### Flow as a Graph Problem

A digital elevation model is a grid of cells. Each cell can pass water to one or more **downslope neighbors**.

**Graph representation:**
- **Nodes:** Grid cells
- **Edges:** Flow connections from one cell to a downslope neighbor
- **Directed:** Water flows in one direction (downhill)

**Flow routing algorithms:**
1. **D8 (Deterministic 8-direction):** Flow goes to the **steepest** of 8 neighbors
2. **D-infinity:** Flow direction can be any angle (not constrained to 8 directions)
3. **Multiple flow direction (MFD):** Flow splits among all downslope neighbors

This model focuses on **D8** — the simplest and most widely used.

### Local Rule, Global Pattern

**Local rule:** At each cell, send water to the steepest downslope neighbor.

**Global pattern:** This creates a **dendritic network** — a branching tree structure where small tributaries merge into larger streams.

**Key insight:** Complex drainage networks emerge from a simple local optimization (follow the steepest descent).

---

## 3. Building the Mathematical Model

### Step 1: Flow Direction (D8 Algorithm)

For each cell $(i, j)$, examine the 8 neighbors:

```
[i-1,j-1]  [i-1,j]  [i-1,j+1]
[i,j-1]    [i,j]    [i,j+1]
[i+1,j-1]  [i+1,j]  [i+1,j+1]
```

For each neighbor $n$, compute the **slope** from $(i, j)$ to $n$:

$$s_n = \frac{z_{i,j} - z_n}{d_n}$$

Where:
- $z_{i,j}$ is the elevation of the center cell
- $z_n$ is the elevation of neighbor $n$
- $d_n$ is the distance to neighbor $n$:
  - Cardinal neighbors (N, S, E, W): $d = \Delta x$ (cell size)
  - Diagonal neighbors (NE, SE, SW, NW): $d = \Delta x \sqrt{2}$

**Flow direction:** The neighbor with the **maximum** positive slope (steepest descent).

If all neighbors are upslope or equal elevation, the cell is a **sink** (local minimum) — water pools here.

### Step 2: Flow Accumulation

Once flow direction is determined for every cell, trace water **upstream** to count how many cells drain through each location.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize accumulation to 1 for every cell (each cell contributes itself)
2. Process cells in order from **highest to lowest elevation**
3. For each cell, add its accumulation to the accumulation of its downstream neighbor

**Result:** Cells with high accumulation values are **streams** — many upstream cells drain through them.

### Step 3: Watershed Delineation

A **watershed** (or catchment) is the area that drains to a specific outlet.

**Algorithm:**
1. Choose an **outlet** cell (e.g., where a stream exits the DEM)
2. Trace **upstream** from the outlet, marking all cells that flow (directly or indirectly) to it
3. The marked cells form the watershed

**Multiple watersheds:** Divide the landscape by tracing from multiple outlets. Cells on **ridges** are watershed boundaries (divides).

### Step 4: Stream Network Extraction

Cells with accumulation above a threshold are classified as **streams**.

**Threshold:** e.g., accumulation > 100 cells (0.1 km² if cells are 30 m × 30 m).

**Network topology:** Streams connect where tributaries meet. The flow direction graph defines the network structure.

## 4. Worked Example by Hand

**Problem:** A 5×5 DEM with cell size 10 m:

```
     Col 0   Col 1   Col 2   Col 3   Col 4
Row 0:  20      19      18      17      16
Row 1:  19      18      17      16      15
Row 2:  18      17      16      15      14
Row 3:  17      16      15      14      13
Row 4:  16      15      14      13      12
```

(a) Determine the flow direction for cell (2, 2) using D8.  
(b) If every cell contributes 1 unit of flow, what is the flow accumulation at cell (4, 4)?

### Solution

**(a) Flow direction from cell (2, 2)**

Cell (2, 2) has elevation $z = 16$ m.

**Eight neighbors:**

| Neighbor    | Row | Col | Elevation | Distance | Slope             |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| NW          | 1   | 1   | 18        | 14.14 m  | (16-18)/14.14 = -0.141 (uphill) |
| N           | 1   | 2   | 17        | 10 m     | (16-17)/10 = -0.1 (uphill) |
| NE          | 1   | 3   | 16        | 14.14 m  | (16-16)/14.14 = 0 (flat) |
| E           | 2   | 3   | 15        | 10 m     | (16-15)/10 = **0.1** |
| SE          | 3   | 3   | 14        | 14.14 m  | (16-14)/14.14 = **0.141** ✓ |
| S           | 3   | 2   | 15        | 10 m     | (16-15)/10 = 0.1 |
| SW          | 3   | 1   | 16        | 14.14 m  | (16-16)/14.14 = 0 |
| W           | 2   | 1   | 17        | 10 m     | (16-17)/10 = -0.1 (uphill) |

**Steepest descent:** SE (slope = 0.141)

**Flow direction from (2, 2): Southeast → cell (3, 3)**

**(b) Flow accumulation at (4, 4)**

Cell (4, 4) is the **lowest point** (elevation 12 m) — all other cells ultimately drain here.

Trace upstream to count contributing cells:

Every cell in the grid flows toward (4, 4) along the gradient. The entire 5×5 grid = **25 cells** contribute.

**Flow accumulation at (4, 4): 25**

(This assumes uniform diagonal flow pattern. In reality, D8 creates a specific tree structure, but for this uniformly sloping DEM, all paths lead to the corner.)

**Try this:**
- **Plane:** Uniform flow direction; accumulation increases downslope
- **Valley:** Flow converges to valley axis; high accumulation along the channel
- **Ridge:** Flow diverges from ridgeline; low accumulation on the crest
- **Cone:** Radial flow from peak; accumulation low everywhere
- **Crater:** Flow converges to the center (sink); high accumulation in the crater

**Key insight:** High accumulation → streams. Low accumulation → ridges or hillslopes.

## 6. Interpretation

### Stream Network Threshold

**Question:** At what accumulation value does a "stream" begin?

**Answer:** Depends on climate, geology, vegetation. Typical thresholds:
- **Humid regions:** 0.1–1 km² contributing area
- **Arid regions:** 10–100 km² contributing area

If cell size = 30 m, then 1 km² = 1,111 cells.

**Stream order:** Classify streams by their position in the network (Strahler ordering, Shreve ordering).

### Watershed Area

Sum the number of cells in a watershed, multiply by cell area:

$$A_{\text{watershed}} = N_{\text{cells}} \times (\Delta x)^2$$

**Example:** 5000 cells, 30 m cell size:

$$A = 5000 \times (30)^2 = 4,500,000 \text{ m}^2 = 4.5 \text{ km}^2$$

### Sinks and Depressions

Real DEMs often contain **sinks** — cells lower than all neighbors (artifacts or real depressions like lakes).

**Problem:** Water accumulates in sinks and can't flow out, breaking the drainage network.

**Solution:** **Fill sinks** — raise sink elevations to the lowest pour point (the lowest cell on the perimeter of the depression).

---

## 7. What Could Go Wrong?

### Flat Areas

If multiple cells have identical elevation, slope is zero in all directions — flow direction is ambiguous.

**Solutions:**
- Add small random perturbations to elevations
- Use **flow direction from surrounding higher cells** to infer flow across flats
- Specialized flat-routing algorithms

### Parallel Flow on Uniform Slopes

D8 forces flow into discrete 45° sectors. On a uniformly tilted plane, flow should be perpendicular to contours, but D8 approximates this with stepped paths.

**D-infinity** (infinite-direction) algorithms handle this better but are more complex.

### Spurious Sinks from Noise

Low-quality DEMs have measurement errors that create artificial pits.

**Solution:** Smooth the DEM before flow routing (but not so much that real features disappear).

### Edge Effects

Flow at the edge of a DEM exits the grid. These cells need special handling (treat as outlets or mark as no-data).

---

## 8. Extension: Real-World Applications

### Flood Prediction

Given rainfall intensity and duration, route water across the DEM to predict:
- **Peak discharge** at stream gauges
- **Inundation extent** (which areas flood)
- **Time to peak** (how long until floodwaters arrive)

### Erosion and Sediment Transport

Flow accumulation is a proxy for **stream power** — the ability to erode and transport sediment.

High accumulation + steep slope = high erosion potential.

### Pollution Routing

Track contaminants (agricultural runoff, industrial spills) as they move downslope through the drainage network.

### Ecosystem Connectivity

Flow networks define **hydrologic connectivity** — which wetlands, streams, and riparian zones are linked. Important for fish migration, amphibian breeding, nutrient cycling.

---

## 9. Math Refresher: Graphs and Traversal

### Graph Terminology

**Graph:** A set of **nodes** (vertices) connected by **edges**.

**Directed graph:** Edges have direction (A → B, not B → A).

**Tree:** A connected graph with no cycles.

### Traversal Algorithms

**Depth-first search (DFS):** Follow one path as far as possible before backtracking.

**Breadth-first search (BFS):** Explore all neighbors before moving to the next level.

For flow accumulation, we process cells in **topological order** (upstream to downstream), which requires sorting by elevation.

### Connectivity

Two cells are **hydrologically connected** if there's a flow path from one to the other.

A **watershed** is a connected component of the flow graph rooted at an outlet.
